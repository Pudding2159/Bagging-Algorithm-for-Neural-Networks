### Overview

This GitHub repository explores the significance of bagging in the realm of machine learning. It showcases how bagging can notably enhance the performance of neural networks when tasked with solving complex multi-class classification problems, exemplified using the Iris dataset.

### Unveiling Bagging

Bagging, short for "bootstrap aggregating," is a potent technique designed to combat overfitting. It achieves this by creating multiple data subsets, training individual models on each subset, and then combining their predictions.

### Performance Enhancement

The core focus of this project is to underscore how the bagging algorithm can greatly improve model performance and stability. We gauge the ensemble model's effectiveness using fundamental metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and log-loss, drawing comparisons with baseline models.

### Key Insights

By exploring this repository, you'll gain insights into the pivotal role of bagging in machine learning. It offers a clear perspective on how bagging can elevate model performance, making it an invaluable tool for addressing complex classification challenges.
